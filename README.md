## Getting Started

Provide instructions on how to set up the project locally. Include any prerequisites, installation steps, and configuration details.

```bash
# Example installation steps
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Functionality

Explain how to use the functionality provided by your project. Provide code examples, usage scenarios, and any necessary details.

## Makefile

The project includes a Makefile with convenient targets for common tasks. Here are the main targets:

- `format`: Format the code using black and isort.
- `lint`: Run linting using pylint.
- `typecheck`: Run type checking using mypy.
- `test`: Run tests using pytest.
- `all`: Run all the above targets.

#### Usage

```bash
make            # Run all tasks
make format     # Format the code
make lint       # Run linting
make typecheck  # Run type checking
make test       # Run tests
```

## Linting and Type Checking

The project uses [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) for linting and [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking.

```bash

make lint

make typecheck
```

## Testing

The project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for testing.

```bash

make test

```
